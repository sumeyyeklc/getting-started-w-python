## Introducing Myself : 
**Hey**,I am 16 and new to the Git version control system. 
I want to improve my skills in the Python language. 
To learn both Python and the Git version control system, I want to start by committing what I learn in Python here.

## Topics to begin :
- String
- Lists, tuples and sets
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops and iterations
- Functions
- Importing Modules

**That's all for now:)**
